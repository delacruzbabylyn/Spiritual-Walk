                <div class="P">  An "Encounter God Retreat" for born-again Christians is a spiritual event designed to deepen participants' personal relationship with God and renew their faith. It provides an opportunity for individuals to step away from daily distractions and focus on spiritual growth through prayer, worship, and teachings. The retreat emphasizes having a direct and personal encounter with God's presence, offering moments for individuals to experience His love, guidance, and healing. It typically includes Bible study, discussions, and fellowship, where participants can learn more about God's love, salvation, and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. The retreat may also address inner healing and deliverance, helping participants break free from spiritual strongholds and struggles. Ultimately, the goal of the retreat is transformation, as individuals leave feeling spiritually renewed, more connected to God, and committed to living out their faith.

                <div class="P">  a Sunday service is a time of worship, prayer, Bible teaching, and fellowship, typically held to honor the resurrection of Jesus. It’s an important part of spiritual life, providing an opportunity for believers to grow in faith, encourage one another, and strengthen their relationship with God. The practice is rooted in the Bible, with early Christians gathering on Sundays to break bread and hear teaching (Acts 20:7) and Hebrews 10:25 emphasizing the importance of meeting together.

                <div class="head"> Soaking</div>  
                <div class="P"> In a biblical context, soaking refers to a deep, prolonged time of worship, prayer, and meditation, where a person is fully immersed in God’s presence. It is a spiritual practice that focuses on quieting the mind and heart to allow God’s Spirit to speak, heal, and renew. While the term "soaking" itself is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, the concept is rooted in the idea of being still before God, allowing His presence to wash over you.

                    In Psalm 46:10, the Bible says, "Be still, and know that I am God," which aligns with the practice of soaking—taking time to rest in God's presence, focusing on Him rather than distractions. Additionally, in the New Testament, Luke 10:39 highlights the story of Mary sitting at Jesus’ feet, listening to Him, which can be seen as a form of soaking in His teaching and presence. The goal of soaking is to deepen one's intimacy with God, receive His peace, and experience spiritual renewal.
