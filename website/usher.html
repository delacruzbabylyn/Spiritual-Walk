           <div class="head"> What is Evangelism Ministry</div>  
            <div class="P">Evangelism Ministry is a vital part of the Christian faith, focused on spreading the message of Jesus Christ and inviting others to experience His love and salvation. The ministry seeks to reach out to those who may not know Christ through various means such as preaching, mission trips, community outreach, and personal testimonies. Its primary goal is to share the gospel, build relationships, and ultimately lead individuals to a personal relationship with Jesus. Evangelism can be done locally or globally, through face-to-face interactions, events, or even digital platforms, making it a dynamic and crucial ministry for churches and believers. By engaging in evangelism, the ministry helps to fulfill the Great Commission, encouraging people to make disciples and spread the Good News to all corners of the world.
